# Fake-News-Prediction

The widespread problem of fake news is very difficult to tackle in todayâ€™s digital world where there are thousands of information sharing platforms through which fake news or misinformation may propagate.

Our project deals with the process of fake news detection to ensure unreal or misleading information is not spread, to maintain peace and order in our society by training a combination of different Machine Learning Classification algorithms. By comparing the accuracy scores of the ML algorthims used, we can evaluate the performance of the various models used.

The Machine Learning algorithms used in this project include:
1.	Logistic Regression
2.	Decision Tree
3.	Support Vector Machines
4.	Multinomial Naive Bayes
5.	Random Forest Classifier
